This project demonstrates the development of backend using Node.js with express.

We have 2 collections students and mentors, we have endpoints for CRUD operations.
There is a reference from students collection to mentors collection, when a student record is added with mentor, the specific mentor record will be created automatically if it's not created already and the students will be automatically added to Mentors.students array in database.

Also when a mentor changes for a student, that particular student id automatically removed from a mentors.students array and added to the new mentors.students array.

Here we can see what endpoints does what:

# For Students record:

## /api/students/ --> POST Request
    It's used to create students with the help of student schema.
